# Design Documents

## 1. Writeups of the Design

### 1.1 Overview

Describe the purpose of your application. Include information about the theme, which is "Astronomy Picture of the Day," and explain how your application fits within this theme.

### 1.2 Features

Outline the key features of your application:

- **User Registration:** Explain how users will sign up and manage their accounts.
- **Alert System:** Describe how users will receive alerts for the Astronomy Picture of the Day.
- **NASA API Integration:** Explain how your application will connect to NASA's API to fetch the Astronomy Picture of the Day.
- **Database Storage:** Detail how the application will store user-selected dates and associated images.

### 1.3 Technology Stack

List the tools and technologies you plan to use for the project:

- **Frontend:** [e.g., React, Angular, or Vue]
- **Backend:** [e.g., Node.js, Django, Flask, or Express]
- **Database:** [e.g., MongoDB, MySQL, or PostgreSQL]
- **NASA API:** [Provide the link to the API documentation]
- **Hosting:** [e.g., Heroku, AWS, or Azure]

### 1.4 Development Timeline

Estimate the time you expect to spend on each part of the development:

- **User Registration:** [Estimated time]
- **Alert System:** [Estimated time]
- **NASA API Integration:** [Estimated time]
- **Database Setup:** [Estimated time]
- **Testing and Debugging:** [Estimated time]

## 2. API Documentation

Provide a detailed document on how your application will interact with NASA's API. Include:

- Endpoints used
- Authentication process (using the API key)
- Expected response format
- Error handling mechanisms

## 3. Database Documentation

Create UML diagrams or similar documentation to illustrate the database structure. Include:

- Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)
- Data types for each attribute
- Relationships between tables
- Primary and foreign keys

## 4. Wireframes

Create wireframes for the user interface (UI) of your application. Include screens for:

- User Registration
- User Dashboard
- Alert Settings
- Display of Astronomy Picture of the Day
- Date Selection and Image Storage

Ensure that the wireframes convey the flow of user interactions and the overall user experience.

Once you have these documents ready, organize them in a directory named "Design Documents" and store it in your Git repository. This will serve as a comprehensive guide for both you and your team during the development phase.
